- Hi, I’m Tomas Kindahl
- I use this github account mostly for teaching, otherwise for some C/C++ OpenGL experimentation
- Currently I'm not learning, just teaching. This year I learnt (and tought) docker, flask,
  azure virtual machine teaching, data warehouses, some machine learning, etc..
- I’m not looking for any collaboration, I have my hands full with my teaching profession
- How to reach me ... my pupils know
