- Hi, I’m Tomas Kindahl
- I'm a teacher in embedded systems, computing and networking at [Skill Scandinavia](https://skill.se/).
- I use this github account mostly for teaching, otherwise for some C/C++ OpenGL experimentation.
- I have informally university courses counterparting (more than) the defunct four years Computer Science
  Program at Linköping Institute of Technology (part of Linköping's University):
     - programming and software development, mainly Lisp and Pascal,
     - AI (the old style),
     - linguistics, logic,
     - the usual university math (basic analysis).
- I also have 1 year of University maths: algebra, mathematical analysis in multiple dimensions,
- Some course in the behavioral sciences, pedagogy, psychology, science philosophy, etc.
- Currently I'm learning some CD/CI for production of teaching material for an advanced programming
  course. I've historically tought myself:
     - Linux installation, bash, awk, networking, C, C++-programming,
     - Java, C#, MySQL, Postgres, Scala,
     - embedded systems and IoT,
     - docker, flask, azure virtual machines, data warehouses, some machine learning,
- at my retirement (2028) I'm going to learn modern GLFW, OpenGL, the D programming language, and also
  some Rust (only for computer science reasons, it breaks three programming paradigms violently which in
  my estimation will punish the companies that use it severely in the long run),
- I’m not looking for any collaboration, I have my hands full with my teaching profession,
  Later on I might want to develop a desktop application for learning, teaching and course development,
  but I'm not there yet. The application will then be a portable one that works on multiple operating
  systems, and is easily usable also on mobile phones.
