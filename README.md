- Hi, I’m Tomas Kindahl
- I'm a teacher in embedded systems, computing and networking at [Skill Scandinavia](https://skill.se/).
- I use this github account mostly for teaching, otherwise for some C/C++ OpenGL experimentation.
- Currently I'm not learning, just teaching. A couple of years ago I learnt more about (and taught) docker,
  flask, azure virtual machines, data warehouses, some machine learning, etc.. The teaching role requires
  (sometimes intense) learning of certain topics: what you don't already know, you have to learn by yourself.
- I’m not looking for any collaboration, I have my hands full with my teaching profession.
  Later on I might want to develop a desktop application for learning, teaching and course development,
  but I'm not there yet. The application will then be a portable one that works on multiple operating
  systems, and is easily usable also on mobile phones.
